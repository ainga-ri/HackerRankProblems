# HackerRankProblems

Hello everyone my name is Alfred and I just deleted by accident my README by forcing a push, now I know i can't do it again in the main branch!

I'm starting repository as a way to save and have my problems coding anywhere. So it's for me but I'd be happy to talk about it with other coders!

So this is a start of my computer scinece career and here is the to do list I have at the moment:

- [x] 30 days of code :1st_place_medal:
- [ ] Java :2nd_place_medal:
- [ ] Problem Solving :3rd_place_medal:
- [ ] Python :1st_place_medal:
- [ ] Interview Preparation Kit - 10/69 Challenges

Note: Python was my very first language and I'm very comfortable using it, that's why you'll see the most of material in this language. Even though, I use C and Java in university so I'll probably write some problems (even same problems) in this languages to get used to their syntax.
