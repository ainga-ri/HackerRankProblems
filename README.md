# HackerRankProblems

Hello everyone my name is Alfred and I just deleted by accident my README by forcing a push, now I know i can't do it again in the main branch!

I'm starting repository as a way to save and have my problems coding anywhere. So it's for me but I'd be happy to talk about it with other coders!

So this is a start of my computer scinece career and here is the to do list I have at the moment:

- [x] 30 days of code
- [ ] Interview Preparation Kit
- [ ] Problem Solving
- [ ] Python
